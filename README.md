# Image-Gallery

This is an Image Gallery app in MERN stack where you can upload images. You can upload image via selecting the file or just by drag and drop.
For storing the image I have used [filestack](https://www.filestack.com/). After filestack gives us the link we are then saving that link along with the title and description to the mongodb database.

## Folder-Structure

In this project we have two folders one for the backend and other for frontend. In the .env of backend add your API key for filestack and MongodDB-URI. After that type` npm install` and `npm run dev` this is start your development server.
Frontend part is pretty straight forward just type `npm install` and `npm start`.
